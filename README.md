## Manual things before running this
- In case of using WSL, install VScode in Windows and check the location of settings.json and keybindings.json

## Manual things after running this
- Check that the scripts permissions are set to 700

## TODO
- Move aliases load to ~/.profile
- In Linux use symbolink links instead of copy VScode files
- Pass a parameter to zsh.sh to differentiate wheter is called from a script or executed
